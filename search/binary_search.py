# splits list data in two by index position
# [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
# works by adding first index position [0] and last index position [9] and dividing the result by 2 (= 4.5)
# (0+9)/2 = 4.5
# rounds off?
# compares to target value
# if target value = 3, it compares it to ___ in the list and discards the other half of the list values until it reaches the target?
